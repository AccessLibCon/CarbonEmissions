    "> According to the [American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/aceee-cached-research.pdf) it takes 5.12 kWh of electricity per gigabyte of transferred data. And according to the [Department of Energy](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DOE-CO2-Emissions-Generation-Electric-Power-2000.pdf) the average US power plant expends 600 grams of carbon dioxide for every kWh generated. That means that transferring 1GB of data produces 3kg of CO2. [https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/does-irresponsible-web-development-contribute-to-global-warming/]\n",
